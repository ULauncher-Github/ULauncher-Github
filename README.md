# About Us
**Unix-Launcher** is an **experiment**, is it possible to make a good well-designed minecraft launcher in python only?
We have two people in our team, me aka **Kiwix** (General, Coding, Dev, Github). And Unikat aka **Unekta** (Some sort of help, Some helping with design)
This github account **only for Unix-Launcher** and nothing else, i did this because for some reason **my main github account got banned lol**.
